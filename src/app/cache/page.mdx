# Our Caching Methods
Reduce the number of API calls and improve the performance of your app by caching responses. In this guide, we will look at how to use caching methods in your app.

## Cache Decorator
The `@Cache` decorator allows you to cache the response of a method. The decorator takes an optional `ttl` parameter, which specifies the time-to-live in seconds for the cache.
