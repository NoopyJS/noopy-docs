# Swagger
With Swagger, you can document your API and make it easier for developers to understand and consume your API. Swagger is a powerful tool that allows you to define, document, and consume RESTful web services. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows developers to interact with your API and understand the endpoints, parameters, and responses.

## Swagger Decorator
The `@Swagger` decorator allows you to document your API endpoints. The decorator takes an optional `description` parameter, which specifies the description of the endpoint.
