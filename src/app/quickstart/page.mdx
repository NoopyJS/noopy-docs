# Noopy Quickstart Guide

Welcome to Noopy! This guide will take you through the steps to set up and launch a foundational project with the Noopy framework, featuring built-in support for **authentication**, **Swagger documentation**, **caching**, **decorators**, a robust **CLI**, and **ORM** capabilities.
## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 12 or higher)
- **npm** (version 6 or higher) or **yarn**

## Installation

[//]: # (<Note>)

[//]: # (  Before you can make requests to the Protocol API, you will need to grab your)

[//]: # (  API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Settings &raquo; API]&#40;#&#41;.)

[//]: # (</Note>)

To install the Noopy CLI globally, use the following command:

<CodeGroup title={""}>

```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
npm install -g noopy
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/sdks" variant="text" arrow="right">
      <>Explore all available Noopy commands</>
  </Button>
</div>

## Create a New Noopy Project

You can quickly generate a new Noopy project using the CLI command below:

<CodeGroup title={""}>
```bash
noopy new my-noopy-app
cd my-noopy-app
```
</CodeGroup>

## Project Structure Overview

After running the `noopy new` command, your new project will have the following directory structure:

<CodeGroup title={""} copyButtonVisible={false}>

```bash
my-noopy-app/
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/    # Define your route handlers here
│   ├── services/       # Business logic and data services
│   ├── config/         # Environment and configuration settings
│   └── app.js          # Entry point for your application
└── package.json        # Project dependencies and scripts
```

</CodeGroup>

## Start the development server

To launch the development server, run the following command:


<CodeGroup title={""}>

```bash
noopy start ( -d | --dev )
```

</CodeGroup>

This will start the server on the default port 3000, allowing you to begin testing and developing your Noopy application.

[//]: # (  <Button href="/conversations" variant="text" arrow="right">)

[//]: # (    <>Read the docs for the Conversations endpoint</>)

[//]: # (  </Button>)

[//]: # (</div>)

[//]: # (## What's next?)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Great, you're now set up with an API client and have made your first request to the API. Here are a few links that might be handy as you venture further into the Protocol API:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (- [Grab your API key from the Protocol dashboard]&#40;#&#41;)

[//]: # (- [Check out the Conversations endpoint]&#40;/conversations&#41;)
